# QUBO_DMD_ROM
Using Quadratic Unconstrainted Binary Optimization (QUBO) iteratively to advance a linearized system identified from Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to build a Reduced-order Model (ROM)

Code to run: "QUBO_DMD_ROM.ipynb"

Data to import: "Limit_Cycle_Unscaled.npy" in /Data/ folder

Notes for execution:
Change the inputs to the model (number of modes & precision) to compare QUBO and QUBO-QAOA performance with classical DMD
